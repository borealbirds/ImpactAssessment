Time since disturbance was split into 8 layers, one for each time period from 1985 to 2020. In each layer, the minimum time since disturbance has been reset to zero based on the current year. Thi

SCANFI_1km modelling:
* it's OK that "rock" doesn't get predicted accurately because "rock" is rare on the landscape and often represents urban areas (if HF is not filtered completely from the training set)
* water doesn't need 
* how does the V5 models handle streams/rivers? Are birds predicted there?


*Using CanMin we can say how many km^2 of mines increased from 1990 to 2020





SCANFI/MODIS Rabbit Hole

save PNGs as 990x586

MODIS:
>filter out cropland/urban in training data because 99% has already been filtered out and we're not interested in training the model to predict low HFs
>filter out water from training data because we aren't interested in predicting water
>predict broad classes: trees, non-tree veg, and wetlands in high HF areas
>retain water and wetland areas from high HF dataset
>combine the above two to reconstruct high HF dataset as backfilled dataset + aqueous areas
