Why Soil Organic Carbon at 0–5 cm?
> Indicator of Fertility & Moisture: The topsoil (0–5 cm) typically has the highest organic matter content because of litter input and decomposition, making it a strong proxy for soil fertility and moisture retention.
> Sensitivity to Land Cover: The 0–5 cm layer is also more sensitive to changes in land use or vegetation cover, meaning it may capture subtle differences relevant to your SCANFI_1km classes.

For pH in CaCl₂, the 0–5 cm layer is typically the best choice. This shallow layer is most directly influenced by surface processes like organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling, which in turn affect plant root activity and overall vegetation health. Using the 0–5 cm depth gives you a measurement that is highly relevant to the immediate conditions experienced by vegetation.

SCANFI_1km modelling:
* it's OK that "rock" doesn't get predicted accurately because "rock" is rare on the landscape and often represents urban areas (if HF is not filtered completely from the training set)
* water doesn't need 
* how does the V5 models handle streams/rivers? Are birds predicted there?
